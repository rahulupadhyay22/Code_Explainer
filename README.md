# Code Explainer

This project uses Gradio and PaLM API to explain Python code snippets step-by-step.

## Description

Code Explainer is a Python application that helps users understand Python code snippets by providing detailed explanations. It leverages the PaLM API for text generation and Gradio for creating a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Input:** Users can input Python code snippets.
- **Output:** The application generates step-by-step explanations for the code snippets.
- **User Interface:** Utilizes Gradio to create a simple web-based interface for ease of use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-explainer.git
   cd code-explainer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed.

## Usage

1. Set up your PaLM API key by editing the `config.py` file and adding your API key:

   ```python
   # config.py

   PALM_API_KEY = 'your_palm_api_key_here'
   ```

2. Launch the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:7860` to access the application.

## How it Works

- Users input a Python code snippet into the provided text box.
- The application uses the PaLM API to generate a detailed step-by-step explanation of the code snippet.
- The explanation is displayed in the output text box on the interface.
