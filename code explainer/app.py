  ---------------------
  Example 1: Code Snippet
  x = 10
  def foo():
      global x
      x = 5
  foo()
  print(x)
  Correct output: 5
  Code Explanation: Inside the foo function, the global keyword is used to modify the global variable x to be 5.
  So, print(x) outside the function prints the modified value, which is 5.
  ---------------------
  Example 2: Code Snippet
  def modify_list(input_list):
      input_list.append(4)
      input_list = [1, 2, 3]
  my_list = [0]
  modify_list(my_list)
  print(my_list)
  Correct output: [0, 4]
  Code Explanation: Inside the modify_list function, an element 4 is appended to input_list.
  Then, input_list is reassigned to a new list [1, 2, 3], but this change doesn't affect the original list.
  So, print(my_list) outputs [0, 4].

  Your task is to act as any language Code Explainer.
  I'll give you a Code Snippet.
  Your job is to explain the Code Snippet step-by-step.
  Break down the code into as many steps as possible.
